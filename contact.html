    <p class="description">Our photoshoot process begins with a chat to explore ideas if you don't have any in mind. We'll work together to decide on outfits and on a cool place for the shoot. <br> <br>
        When the shoot day arrives, we'll take lots of pictures. Afterward, you'll get X number of photos to keep and use however you like. I'll also pick some photos that I think are great for the project I create out of our shoot, and if you're happy with them, I'll use those. <br> <br>
        It's all about making sure you feel comfortable and that the pictures we take really capture your style and story. I'm here to make sure you're happy with the whole process from start to finish.</p>
