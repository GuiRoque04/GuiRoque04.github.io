            <p id="about-text">
                I started my photography journey late 2022, and have since been improving mt style by finding inspiration in the entertainment world, from celebrities and movies to TV shows and video games. I find inspiration all around me. <br><br>

                I'm also influenced by the artistry of Yulia Gorbchenko and Jack Bridgeland, whose distinct styles and visions have left a lasting impression on my work. I strive to infuse their influence with my own creative spin. <br><br>

                I specialize in creating intimate, up-close portraits that capture your true essence. Whether it's a casual session or a professional shoot, my goal is to make you comfortable in front of the camera and deliver portraits that resonate with who you are, and portraits that showcase my creativity and artistry. <br><br>

                Take a look through my portfolio and let's connect to create your next memorable portrait session.
